            > Viewing Selfies (accessPhotos()) \n
            - The SDK should allow users to view previously taken selfies. \n\n

            -> User Authentication (authenticateUser()) \n
            - The SDK should authenticate the user using the device`s built-in biometric capabilities before granting access to the photos. \n
